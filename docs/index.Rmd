### Overview

This dashboard presents two key pieces of data analysis:

1. Case Incidence
2. Estimated spread of COVID19

**Case Incidence**

This presents the daily number of cumulative cases, and daily cases of COVID19 for selected countries around the world. The data is drawn from the [European CDC](), which has collected data from various governing agencies around the world. There are some small discrepancies between this data and that given by the official Australian government results, but in the absence of up to date easily obtainable data from Australia, this is the highest quality data that we have.

**Estimated spread of COVID19**

Column  {.tabset}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Explanation

**Case Incidence**

This presents the daily number of cumulative cases, and daily cases of COVID19 for selected countries around the world. The data is drawn from the [European CDC](), which has collected data from various governing agencies around the world. There are some small discrepancies between this data and that given by the official Australian government results, but in the absence of up to date easily obtainable data from Australia, this is the highest quality data that we have.

### Cumulative Incidence for selected countries

```{r since-100}
covid_since_100 <- covid %>% 
  add_days_since_limit(limit = 100) %>% 
  filter(days_since_limit >= 0)

```

```{r gg-cumulative-incidence}

gg_covid_cumulative_exceed_limit(covid_since_100,
                                 limit = 100) + 
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) 
  # ggthemes::scale_colour_colorblind() +
  # annotation_logticks(sides = "l") 
```


### Australian incidence

```{r oz-cases}
library(glue)
covid_since_100_au <- covid_since_100 %>% 
  filter(geo_id == "AU") 
  
oz_cases_max_date <- format(max(covid_since_100_au$date), "%d %B %Y")
oz_cases_min_date <- format(min(covid_since_100_au$date), "%d %B %Y")

gg_cases <- ggplot(covid_since_100_au,
       aes(x = date,
           y = cases)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "black") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 epidemic case incidence",
       subtitle = glue(
         "For Australia from {oz_cases_min_date} to {oz_cases_max_date}"
       ),
       x = "Date since cumulative cases exceeded 100",
       y = "New Cases",

gg_cases
  
```

### Australian incidence (semi-log)

```{r oz-cases-log10}
gg_cases +
   scale_y_log10() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  # annotation_logticks() + 
  labs(y = "New Cases (Log Scale")

### Explanation

### Selected Countries


```{r covid-instant-repro}
covid_instant_r <- add_instant_reproduction(covid_changepoint)
```


```{r gg-effective-repro-all, cache = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12, cache = FALSE}
gg_effective_repro_all(covid_instant_r) + 
  # ggthemes::scale_colour_colorblind() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
  # annotation_logticks() 
```


### Per Country

```{r gg-effective-r-facet, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12}
gg_effective_repro_facet(covid_instant_r)  + 
  # ggthemes::scale_colour_colorblind() + 
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
  # annotation_logticks() 
```


$R_{t}$ for NSW {.storyboard}
=======================================================================

### Explanation

The total number of incident cases arising at timestep $t$, $I_t$, is the sum of the numbers of incident local ($I_{t}^{local}$) and imported ($I_{t}^{imported}$) cases,

$$ I_t = I_t^{local} + I_t^{imported} $$

It is assumed that, if imported cases exist, they can be distinguished from local cases, for instance through epidemiological investigations, so that 
 $I_{t}^{local}$ and $I_{t}^{imported}$ are observed at each timestep.


$$\Lambda_t(w_s) = \sum_{s=1}^t (I_{t-s}^{local} + I_{t-s}^{imported}) w_s = \sum_{s=1}^t I_{t-s} w_s $$
$$ \mathbb E(I_t^{local} | I_0, I_1, \ldots, I_{t-1}, w_s, T_t) = R_t\Lambda_t (w_s)$$

### **NSW -- adjusting for potential under-ascertainment, locally-acquired & overseas-acquired cases treated separately**, (cases under investigation excluded), parametric serial interval distribution

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
UA1a / UA2a / UA3a / UA4a + plot_layout(heights=c(2,1,1,1))
```

***

In these plots, the counts of incident cases with presumed local sources of infection have been inflated by a factor of 10, and the counts of cases with presumed overseas sources of infection inflated by a factor of 1.5. This mimics ten-fold under-ascertainment of locally-transmitted cases, and 50% under-ascertainment of inbound cases.
